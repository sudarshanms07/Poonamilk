        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Our Farm Milk</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Direct from our farm to your home, Poona Milk is bottled and delivered fresh, chilled to 4°C to your doorstep. Our high standards of hygiene and quality control ensure you get the best cow and buffalo milk in every way.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Organic Means</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">We believe in producing the purest and 100% natural milk in Pune, maintaining organic farming standards. Our farms nurture local wildlife, prevent illness naturally, and promote free-range grazing.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Glass Bottles for Purity</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Our milk comes in glass bottles to preserve its taste and avoid toxins from plastic, which are linked to serious health issues.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">No Antibiotics Policy</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Unlike intensive farms, we do not use antibiotics routinely. Our cows receive natural care, and antibiotics are only used when absolutely necessary.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Why Organic Costs More</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Organic milk is priced higher due to the cost of organic feed, fewer cows per acre, and lower natural milk production levels. This ensures better animal welfare and pure milk quality.</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-2">Chilled for Freshness</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">Our milk is chilled to 4°C within an hour of collection and stored in controlled conditions to maintain its freshness and safety, even during rare power cuts.</p>
